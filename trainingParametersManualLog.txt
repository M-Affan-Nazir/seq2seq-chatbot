1) 
    Architecture  1:

    Note:
    You can add more than 1 attention layers
    second attention layer can be added ON THE OUTPUT of the first attention layer to create a more complex relationship
    Second attention layer can be added to the same inputs as given to the first attention layer (or different inputs; as per infrasructure)
    Careful plan of instructure (which different inputs to attention layer) has to be done; in order for full potential to be utilized'
    Next: Add an attention Layer


2) 
    Architecture  2:
    
    1 Attention layer 

    Note:
    Model is performing better.
    Next: Add validation data and checkpoint
